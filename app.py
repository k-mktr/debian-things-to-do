# Debian NATTD Not Another "Things To Do"!
# Initial System Setup Shell Script Builder for Debian
#
# This application is a Streamlit-based web interface that allows users to customize
# and generate a shell script for setting up a fresh Debian installation.
# It provides options for system configuration, essential and additional app installation,
# and system customization. The app uses predefined profiles and allows users to select
# individual options or apply preset profiles. It generates a downloadable shell script
# based on the user's selections, which can be run on a Debian system to automate the
# setup process.
#
# This tool aims to simplify the post-installation process for Debian users,
# allowing for easy customization and automation of common setup tasks.
